Poshana is basically a crop predictor that comes under Agro-tech theme. It predicts the crop according to the weather and soil nutrients which is fetched by APIS and Manual Datasets. There is a form where users can manually select the region, according to the location our python model will predict the best crop which can be grown in that particular area. The manual location is fetched by measuring both longitude and latitude. We are fetching weather also from weather API. We also add crop which is cultivated most India. We add details of each crop like which climate is best for the particular crop, how much rain it needs to be grown fully and how much nutrients that crop has. We also thought like the agent will to the farm where he/she analyze the soil, the climate and the surrounding area, which gives more accuracy towards better growth of the crop, weâ€™ll going to add this in our future scope.
